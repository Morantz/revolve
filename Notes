TODO: 
 + Switch to AM335x-SM
 + Switch to TMC2130
 + Power out detection. 
 + Add CGND for ESD shielding
 + 4 layer
 + Switch step down and USB hub to TI components.
 + Connect VDDCR
 + Over current protection on USB? A: No...
 + Support for Thermistor and Thermocouple:
 + Calculate voltage divider for step down
 + Check trace lengths on eMMCS? A: Not relevant
 + Check if necessary to use buffer on heaters and fans!
 + Check pricing with Jason on CSD17577Q3A. Also check if gate buffer is necessary. A: No buffer. 
 + Smaller footprint crystal 25MHz
    + Add to BOM. 
 + Add TPS2061 for ganged over current. 
 + Move LAN chip to reduce trace lenghts? 
 + Find out if RTC is possible using battery. A: Dropping RTC.
 + Check bootmode!
 + Add external driver footprints. 
 - Add 22R resistors to USB
 + Check Current measurment resistors on TMC2130
 + Change ESD to TPD4S012
 + Add Grove connectors
 + Add temp sensor
 - Verify that PMOS can be decoupled. 
 - Using CMOS, verify with simulation/meassurment.
 + Check which circuits are running thorugh SYS_5V, for USB.

EMI considerations:
===================
 - Consider 1.8V on MII and LCDC signals. 
 - What is the effect of removing caps on LCDC signals? 
 - TVS diodes on USB needs vias for routing. Is this critical? 


TO_VERIFY: 
 - USB self powered. OK to tie high to USB_DC?
 + Two boot modes, USB for flashing and running, EMMC for running. USB device for initial setup. 
 + USR leds, do they need a transistor? A: No. 
 + Perhaps higher power step down converter? A: Use TPS54202 - 2A.
 + Use Peripheral PLL for RTC? A: Yes, according to Micheal Welling
 - What is the 125MHz limitation on the HDMI? 
    The TDA19988 handles up to 150MHz, 
    The LCDC looks like it can have a pixel clock up to 200 MHz. 
 + Can RESET on USB HUB be connected to reset on SIP? A: Yes. 
 - Analog layout.
 - OK to leave don't care SYSBOOT pins unconnected?     
 + TUSB2046 has +/-4K ESD suppression, no additional ESD required? A: Yes. 

SAVE_COST:
 - Remove microSD slot. Flash/boot from USB instead. 
 - Remove Serial to parallel converters. 
 - Remove RTC crystal
 - 4 stepper version? A: No, only 6.
 - Use built in PWM_SS, remove PWM-chip. 
 - Surface mount components wherever possible. (USB connector,.. )
 - Single side assembly. 
 - 4 layer 6 mil track/gap PCB
 - Switch to 25MHz Crystal on SIP, can also be used for Ethernet? 

Notes: 
 - pr1_pru0_pru_r30[15:0] O PRU0 Register R30 Outputs
 - Removing MMC0 allows PRU direct outputs to step/dir
 - Choosing Z1 and Z2 endstop inputs as direct pru pins, for fast Z-probing. 

**USB HUB**
 - Choosing BUSPWR low to indicate self powered mode. 
 - Choosing EXTMEM high to disable external EEPROM with name. 
 - Choosing EECLK floating since extmem is disabled. 
 - Choosing Ganged power mode to save Bom cost. 
 - 
 - Choosing one two 0.5A and two 1A USB hosts for high power applications like Manga Screen 2
 - Choosing a DNI resistor connected with CLKOUT2 to experiment with eliminating the 6MHz crystal on the USB hub. 
 - Choosing a DNI resistor on TST mode to experiment with 48MHz clock from SIP

 - Typical $2 wifi dongle consumes 70 mA
 - Typical USB thumb drive consumes 110 mA
 - Max Manga Screen consumption is 700 mA
 - Typical Webcam cunsumes 50 mA
 - 1A is pushing it. 1.5A seems ideal.
