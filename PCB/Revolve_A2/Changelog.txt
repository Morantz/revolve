 + missing 5V on USB_VBUS might prevent USB from working in U-boot/Kernel (Switched USB_VBUS to SYS_5V)
 + Missing 1.5K pull-up on USB1_DP (Not needed for new USB hub)
 + USB hub is Full-speed. Change to High speed. 
 + mmc1: switch to bus width 8 failed (No longer routed through A6)
 - Heater E not working. (Probably a software problem.)
 + Consider output voltage on external drivers. (added 3.3 and 24V)




Stuff that is working:
 - All PWMs/timers are working so we have 4 heaters + 4 fans. (Not Heater E, might be a software problem)
 - As far as I can tell, the current, voltage and temperature sense on the input is OK, 
but perhaps not enough time to store position if power is lost. It depends on well we can integrate power managent into the Cortex M3 core on the board. 
 - The HDMI output is OK. 
 - USB hub works but is only 12 Mbps
 - Ethernet works
 - USB device works
 - Thermistor inputs.
 - Endstops
 - Thermocouple inputs
 - Steppers!
 - Rotary encoder. 
 - Wifi 

Not working yet:
 - 8 bit eMMC
 - Grove connectors (One I2C, one UART
 - Servos not yet tested. 
 - External stepper drivers
