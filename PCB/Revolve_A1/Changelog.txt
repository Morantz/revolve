TODO: 
-----
 - 
 + Change 10.000 pF to 0.1uF (This was right in the schematic, but seems to have been changed during ordering)
 + Change footprint on Y4
 + Consider dropping 2.2uF (Dropped 1uF, cutting one bom-line)
 + 0201 package on the 18pF caps in the BoM
 + Change 10V 0805 10uF caps to 35V (Where is this? The MPN in schematic is right) 
    + Wrong voltage on 10uF for steppers (PartNo in schemtic is wrong). Use MPN
 + Smaller footprint on C25 (Changed to 6.3mm diameter)
 + Change SOT23 footprints
 + TPD12S01 wrong package in the BoM: (Changed SPN in the schematic)
 + U5 is 5V, should be 12V (changed MPN and SPN)
 + HDMI footprint slightly to the side. 
 + Use the large test points, gather them and place on one side. 
 + Connect USB HUB pin 27 to gnd. (TSTPLL)
 + Ethernet connector wrong footprint 
 + missing pull-up on OC pin 5V usb. 
 + Missing pull-up on USB0_DP ( Not adding pull-up, reference design does not have it. )
 + Missing solder paste on eMMC
 + Mising reset pin on eMMC
 + EP (GND pad) on USB hub not connected to GND. 
 + C20 seems to have blown up.... (It has 3.3V across it, so it seems random)
 + GANGED pin must be pulled high on the USB hub. 
 + Add 22R + 15K pull-downs + caps on transmission lines for the USB. (Dropped Caps, bit otherwise OK)
 + Move Fan LEDs to 3.3V line instead of 24V line. Too bright. 
 + Consider adding an LED to indicate 12/24V is enabled. (Added LED on enable wire)
 + More room around the PMOS chips on the input. (Added tPlace)
 + Move LEDs to make room for connectors. (switched USB device and LEDS)
 + Consider C6-75pF for loop stability on TPS54202 (Added a C6 of 18pF. Can be increased if needed)
 + Change PMIC_PGOOD to be Push/pull compatible.
    ( Using a buffer with an enable input ) 
 + USB1_VBUS connected to SYS_5V. (Conected USB1_VBUS to USB_VBUS)
 + No low voltage tracks under the inductor. Makes noise. (Rerouted out of the way)
 + Missing 1.8V on VDDDC1 and 2 on HDMI 
 + Consider ferrite beads on analog domain.  (Contained in the SiP?)
 + Consider removing diag 1
    (No need to remove it, the design works now)
 + Pin 9 on TMC2130 floating. 
 + Resistors on gates. (Added 100R resistors on high power mosfets to aid in ringing (LC) and current draw.)
 + Move USB and HDMI further apart (Added an indicator for 20mm)
 + Thermistor markings wrong
 + Much noise on the thermistors. Fix layout to reduce noise level. Currently it's 30 mV PP
    (Moved filter closer to SiP input and connected VREFN to AGND_ADC)
 + Remove clkout_25MHz
 + SISS27DN add outline 

 From Octavo:
 + Silk screen errors: (Component names will not be on final board. )
 + Rename +3V3 to sys_vdd1_3v3
 + Make R49 499ohm
 + Fix JTAG header connections
    + TVDD is not pulled high.
    + TCLKRTN is not connected to TCK.
    + EMU0 and EMU1 are not pulled high.
    + JTAG_TRSTN is not pulled low.
    + TDIS is not grounded.
 + Change eMMC pull-ups to 10K. 
 + PMIC_MUX connected to PMIC_MUX_OUT on the SiP
 + Complete top and bottom side ESD ring
 + Remove thermal pour on L1
 + Widen VIN_AC pour
 + Check traces (24V and 12V) for U5: (Max 150mA, so should be OK)
 + Remove VIN_BAT pour. 
 + Increased the traces for the clamping circuit to 0.3 mm (12mil) 
 + Update the PWRONRSTN / WARMRSTN schematic
 + Consider 1.5K resistor on LEDs: (The LEDs are bright enough with 4.7K) 
 + 5.1) Pull Don't care bits to GND. 
 + 5.2) Not adding a 100R resistor due to board space. 
 + 5.4) Make eMMC compatible with V5.0 (Not possible since DAT6 is surrounded on all sides. )
 + 8.1) Connect VREFN to AGND_ADC
 + 8.2) Fixed PMIC_MUX signal is not correct. 
 + 8.3) You might want to change R68, R67 R23 and R69 to 1.5K resistors to improve the brightness of the LEDs. (They are bright enough)
 + Check signals for 90 degree turns
 + Check copper pours for small areas. 
 + Using 4 vias on USB_DC copper pour



From Seeed: 
 + New USB host connectors (Same footprint)
 + New tactile sitches (New foorprint)
 + New capacitors (Same footprint)
 + New edge headers (Same footprint)

Stuff that is working:
 - All PWMs/timers are working so we have 4 heaters + 4 fans. 
 - As far as I can tell, the current, voltage and temperature sense on the input is OK, 
but perhaps not enough time to store position if power is lost. It depends on well we can integrate power managent into the Cortex M3 core on the board. 
 - The HDMI output is OK. 
 - USB hub works with some workarounds. 
 - Ethernet works
 - USB device works
 - Thermistor inputs.
 - Endstops, all but Y1 seems to be working
 - Thermocouple inputs
 - Steppers!

Not working yet:
 - Grove connectors (One I2C, one UART)
 - Servos not yet tested. 
 - Rotary encoder.  
 - External stepper drivers

Board bring-up: 
 - Measured all voltage domains, no shorts. 
 - Applied USB power, no message in kernel. 
 - 3.315V on VDD2
 - 3.339 on VDD3
 - 1.113 on VDD_FPU
 - 1.808 on VDD_RTC
 - 4.95 on SYS_5V
 - 1.807 on VDD_PLL 
 - 1.04 on VDD_CORE
 - 1.40 on VDDS_DDR
